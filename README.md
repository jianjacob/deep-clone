# Deep Clone in 🍦 JS

This is my implementation of Deep Cloning an object using pure JS.

Often asked in coding interviews 💀, rarely ever used without a library like lodash.

Supports the following test cases (at least the ones I've thought up so far):

- empty objects (who wouldn't wanna)
- non-objects
- arrays
- simple objects (POJO)
- nested objects
- complex (?) objects (functions, arrays, nested all at once)

## Usage

Clone the repo and copy the deepClone() method into your project, then import it as necessary.

## License

MIT but hey, it's just a tiny method after all.
